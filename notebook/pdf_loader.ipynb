Twenty-five years\\nago, we lived analog. We communicated using an analog POTS telephone, we tuned\\nin to analog FM radio stations, and we went to the library and browsed the stacks for\\ninformation. Buildings were constructed using hand-drawn blueprints; graphic artists\\nworked with pen, brush, and ink; musicians plucked strings and blew into horns and\\nrecorded on analog tape; and airplanes were controlled by physical cables connecting\\nthe yoke to the control surfaces.\\nBut now everything is computerized and digital. Consequently, every member of\\nsociety needs to be familiar with computers. That does not mean having the deep\\nknowledge of a techie, but just as poets need to study a little math and physics, and\\njust as mathematicians need to read a little poetry, so too does everybody today need\\nto know something about computers.\\nI think that this book really helps to address the knowledge gap between techies and\\nlaypeople, by providing an accessible and easy-to-read discussion of SQL—a core\\ndatabase technology.\\n—Richard Hipp, Creator of SQLite\\nvii'),\n",

The whole\\npoint of technologies like SQL is to allow you to focus on the business problem, and\\nnot worry about how the technical details are executed. This book will give you a\\npractical focus on using SQL, and will steer away from unnecessary technical details\\nthat are likely not pertinent to your immediate needs. Much of the content revolves\\naround hands-on exercises with real databases you can download so you see how\\nconcepts are applied. When you finish this book you will have practical knowledge to\\nwork with databases, as well as use them to overcome your business challenges.\\nHow to Use This Book\\nThis book is designed to teach the fundamentals of SQL and working with databases.\\nReaders who have experience using Excel spreadsheets should find this material\\naccessible but still challenging. Individuals who have not worked with Excel may be\\nmore challenged. It is helpful to be familiar with concepts used in Excel, such as rows,\\ncolumns, tables, mathematical expressions (e.g., Excel formulas), and aggregate calcu‐\\nlations (e.g., SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT). These concepts will still be taught\\nhere, but some practical Excel experience will help expedite understanding.\\nBasic computer literacy is required, and readers should know how to navigate folders\\nand copy/paste files, as well as download and save files from the Web.\\nAs you go through the material, have a computer on hand to practice the examples.\\nWhile some people can learn by just reading, it is best to practice the material at some\\npoint to reinforce the knowledge.\\nProficiency comes through repeated use and practice. In your job, it is likely that you\\nwill use some SQL functionalities heavily and others not as much. That is OK. It is\\nmore important to become proficient in what your job requires, and consult this\\nbook (or Google) as a reference when you need answers about an unfamiliar topic.\\nix'),\n",

A\\nspreadsheet holding customer bookings is a database, and so is a plain-text file con‐\\ntaining flight schedule data. Plain-text data itself can be stored in a variety of formats,\\nincluding XML and CSV .\\nProfessionally, however, when one refers to a “database” they likely are referring to a\\nrelational database management system  (RDBMS). This term may sound technical\\nand intimidating, but an RDBMS is simply a type of database that holds one or more\\ntables that may have relationships to each other.\\nExploring Relational Databases\\nA table should be a familiar concept. It has columns and rows to store data, much like\\na spreadsheet. These tables can have relationships to each other, such as an ORDER\\ntable that refers to a CUSTOMER table for customer information.\\nFor example, suppose we have an ORDER table with a field called CUSTOMER_ID\\n(Figure 2-1).\\nFigure 2-1. An ORDER table with a CUSTOMER_ID\\n3'),\n",

A CUSTOMER table\\nWhen we go through the ORDER table, we can use the CUSTOMER_ID to look up the cus‐\\ntomer information in the CUSTOMER table. This is the fundamental idea behind a “rela‐\\ntional database, ” where tables may have fields that point to information in other\\ntables. This concept may sound familiar if you’ve used VLOOKUP in Excel to retrieve\\ninformation in one sheet from another sheet in a workbook.\\nWhy Separate Tables?\\nBut why are these tables separated and designed this way? The motivation is normal‐\\nization, which is separating the different types of data into their own tables rather\\nthan putting them in one table. If we had all information in a single table, it would be\\nredundant, bloated, and very difficult to maintain. Imagine if we stored customer\\ninformation in the ORDER table. Figure 2-3 shows what it would look like.\\nFigure 2-3. A table that is not normalized\\nNotice that for the Re-Barre Construction orders someone had to populate the cus‐\\ntomer information three times for all three orders (the name, region, street address,\\ncity, state, and zip). This is very redundant, takes up unnecessary storage space, and is\\ndifficult to maintain. Imagine if a customer had an address change and you had to\\nupdate all the orders to reflect that. This is why it is better to separate CUSTOMERS and\\nORDERS into two separate tables. If you need to change a customer’s address, you only\\nneed to change one record in the CUSTOMER table (Figure 2-4).\\n4 | Chapter 2: Databases'),\n",

Other data‐\\nbase solutions are massive and run on a server, supporting thousands of users and\\napplications simultaneously.

These are not necessarily the industry vernacular, but they will\\nhelp clarify the distinction.\\nLightweight Databases\\nIf you are seeking a simple solution for one user or a small number of users (e.g., your\\ncoworkers), a lightweight database is a good place to start. Lightweight databases have\\nlittle to no overhead, meaning they have no servers and are very nimble. Databases\\nare typically stored in a file you can share with others, although it starts to break\\ndown when multiple people make edits to the file simultaneously. When you run into\\nthis problem, you may want to consider migrating to a centralized database.\\nThe two most common lightweight databases are SQLite and Microsoft Access.\\nSQLite is what we will use in this book. It is free, lightweight, and intuitive to use. It is\\nused in most of the devices we touch and can be found in smartphones, satellites, air‐\\ncraft, and car systems. It has virtually no size limitation and is ideal for environments\\nwhere it is not used by more than one person (or at most a few people). Among many\\nother uses, SQLite is ideal to learn SQL due to its ease of installation and simplicity.\\nMicrosoft Access has been around for a while and is inferior to SQLite in terms of\\nscalability and performance.

While this technically works, there is a degree\\nof ambiguity that we were lucky SQLite interpreted correctly. The reason is due to the\\nunclear question of “What conditions belong to the AND and what conditions belong\\nto the OR?” The SQL interpreter could derail quickly and incorrectly interpret that we\\nare looking for rain AND another condition where either the temperature is below 32\\nOR the snow depth is greater than 0.

For example, the ATTENDEE_ID in the\\nATTENDEE table is a primary key, but the ATTENDEE_ID in the\\nPRESENTATION_ATTENDANCE table is a foreign key. The two are joined together for a\\none-to-many relationship. Unlike a primary key, a foreign key does not enforce\\nuniqueness, as it is the “many” in a “one-to-many” relationship.\\nThe primary key and foreign key do not have to share the same field name. The\\nBOOKED_COMPANY_ID in the PRESENTATION table is a foreign key pointing to the\\nCOMPANY_ID in its parent table COMPANY. The field name can be different on the for‐\\neign key to make it more descriptive of its usage. In this case, BOOKED_COMPANY_ID is\\nmore descriptive than just COMPANY_ID. The semantics are subjective but still legiti‐\\nmate as long as the business wording is clear.\\nThe Schema\\nApplying our knowledge of primary keys and foreign keys, we can establish the rela‐\\ntionships between these five tables and draw a database schema as shown in\\nFigure 9-1. A database schema is a diagram showing tables, their columns, and their\\nrelationships. All the primary keys and foreign keys are connected by arrows. The\\nnon-tipped side of the arrow ties to a primary key, while the tipped side points to a\\nforeign key. These arrows visualize how each parent table supplies data to a child\\ntable.\\nThe Schema | 71'),\n",

Well-considered table design, column constraints, and relationships will really\\nshine once we start putting data into the tables. With our strong table design and the\\nwell-thought-out relationships between them, we will be able to join efficiently and\\neasily. When a piece of data needs to be changed (e.g., a customer address), we only\\nneed to change it in one place rather than several. When a bad piece of data comes in,\\nhopefully we have set enough sensible constraints to prevent it from entering the\\ndatabase.\\nIn this chapter, we will learn how to INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE records. Fortunately,\\nwriting operations like these is much simpler than writing SELECT statements.\\nThese SQL write operations do not have to be done by a human. Software (written in\\nJava, Python, or other coding languages) will often generate and execute SQL state‐\\nments to read and write data the same way a human would, but much more effi‐\\nciently. Although this is beyond the scope of this book, coding languages will be\\ntouched on in the next chapter if that is pertinent to you.\\nINSERT\\nIn a relational database, data only exists if the database first receives records. The\\nINSERT statement does just that and inserts a record into the database. Y ou can pick\\nwhat fields to populate in the record, and the rest of the fields will be null or use a\\ndefault value.\\nFirst, we will INSERT an ATTENDEE record into the SurgeTech database we created in\\nthe last chapter.

But the most common date and time tasks\\nwill be covered in this section. Full documentation of SQLite date and time handling\\ncan be found at the SQLite website (http://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html).\\nDate Functions\\nWhen working with dates, it is simplest to store them in the string format YYYY-\\nMM-DD as most database platforms inherently understand this format (technically\\ncalled the ISO8601 format). A four-digit year comes first, following by a two-digit\\nmonth, and a two-digit day, each separated by a dash (e.g., 2015-06-17). If you format\\nyour date strings like this, you will never have to do any explicit conversions.\\nWhen running a query, any string in the 'YYYY-MM-DD' date format will be inter‐\\npreted as a date. This means you can do chronological tasks like comparing one date\\nto another date:\\nSELECT '2015-05-14' > '2015-01-12'\\nIf you do not use this ISO8601 format, SQLite will compare them as text strings and\\ncheck if the first text comes before the second text alphabetically. This obviously is\\nnot desirable as you want dates to be evaluated, compared, and treated as dates.\\nConveniently, you can get today’s date by passing a 'now' string to the DATE() func‐\\ntion:\\nSELECT DATE('now')\\nSQLite also allows you to pass any number of modifier arguments to the DATE() func‐\\ntion. For instance, you can get yesterday’s date by passing '-1 day' as an argument:\\nSELECT DATE('now','-1 day')\\nY ou can pass also pass a date string to the DATE() function, and add any number of\\nmodifiers to transform the date. This example will add three months and subtract one\\nday from 2015-12-07:\\nSELECT DATE('2015-12-07','+3 month','-1 day')\\nThere are several advanced date transformations you can perform. Refer to the\\nSQLite date functions link at the beginning of this section to get a comprehensive\\noverview of these functionalities.\\nTime Functions\\nTime also has a typical format, which is HH:MM:SS (this also is ISO8601 standard).\\nHH is a two-digit military format of hours, MM is a two-digit format of minutes, and\\nSS is a two-digit format of seconds .

But these should provide plenty of leads to\\nexpand your database knowledge beyond this book.\\nAPPENDIX B2 – Improving Performance with Indexes\\nAs your database grows, the performance can start to slow down with SELECT queries.\\nThe machine has to process each record to find ones that match your WHERE condi‐\\ntion, and obviously having more records will slow this process down.\\nA common way to improve performance significantly is to use indexes, a mechanism\\nthat enables faster lookups in a way very similar to an index in a book. An index\\nspeeds up SELECT performance, but it slows down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE state‐\\nments. It will also make the database file larger. These are factors you have to balance\\nin your decision to use them. Y ou should not think about creating indexes when you\\nfirst design a database. Do it later, when you find you are having performance issues.\\nY ou specify an index on one or more columns, and you want these columns to be the\\nones you frequently qualify on. For example, if you frequently query the PRODUCT\\ntable and use a WHERE statement on the price column, you can apply an index on that\\ncolumn as shown here:\\nCREATE INDEX price_index ON PRODUCT(price);\\nWe name the index price_index and we apply it on the PRODUCT table, and in paren‐\\ntheses we specify it on the price column. SQLite will keep a map of which records\\nhave which price values. This will significantly speed up performance when we qual‐\\nify on price. But obviously, when we modify records it has to update this index, so\\nthis overhead will slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.\\nY ou will notice in the SQLiteStudio database navigator that the table contains all the\\nindex objects you have created (see Figure B-1).\\n108 | Appendix B: Supplementary Topics'),\n",

Y ou should avoid using indexes on small tables\\nas the overhead will actually slow performance down (meaning this example was\\ndemonstrational, not something you should actually do to the PRODUCT table).

He enjoys making technical content relatable and rele‐\\nvant to those unfamiliar with or intimidated by it.\\nColophon\\nThe animal on the cover of Getting Started with SQL  is a Natterjack toad ( Epidalea\\ncalamita). It is part of the Bufonidae family and can be found in sand dune systems,\\nheathlands, and coastlines with low coverings of grass throughout western European.\\nAn identifying feature of natterjack toads is the yellow line that runs down the middle\\nof their backs. Adults range in length from 50–70 mm, with females being larger than\\nmales. Overall coloring is either brown, cream, or green, and they are covered in\\nwarts, like their toad brethren. Another distinguishing feature is its shorter hind legs,\\nwhich make it more of a runner than a hopper or walker, as other toads are.\\nLike more common toads, the natterjack diet consists of many invertebrate insects\\nsuch as beetles, spiders, and worms. They are nocturnal hunters, so meals are swal‐\\nlowed whole at night. Those in sand dune systems are also known to eat small crusta‐\\nceans, such as freshwater shrimp. Natterjacks release toxins from their skin, which\\nmake them unlikely to be made into meals themselves, but birds such as grey herons,\\nas well as grass snakes are able to consume them without issue.\\nAs with hunting, the natterjack’s mating rituals are nocturnal. Males have a dinstinct,\\nloud mating call that signals females to head to nearby warm, shallow waters (because\\nnatterjacks are terrible swimmers). This usually occurs between the months of April\\nand July, with females spawning 1,500–7,500 eggs. The eggs turn into tadpoles about\\na week after fertilization, which then turn into toadlets 3–8 weeks later.\\nMany of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to\\nthe world. To learn more about how you can help, go to animals.oreilly.com.\\nThe cover image is from Johnson’s Natural History. The cover fonts are URW Type‐\\nwriter and Guardian Sans. The text font is Adobe Minion Pro; the heading font is\\nAdobe Myriad Condensed; and the code font is Dalton Maag’s Ubuntu Mono.')]"

A four-digit year comes first, following by a two-digit\\nmonth, and a two-digit day, each separated by a dash (e.g., 2015-06-17). If you format\\nyour date strings like this, you will never have to do any explicit conversions.\\nWhen running a query, any string in the 'YYYY-MM-DD' date format will be inter‐\\npreted as a date.

They are nocturnal hunters, so meals are swal‐\\nlowed whole at night. Those in sand dune systems are also known to eat small crusta‐\\nceans, such as freshwater shrimp. Natterjacks release toxins from their skin, which\\nmake them unlikely to be made into meals themselves, but birds such as grey herons,\\nas well as grass snakes are able to consume them without issue.\\nAs with hunting, the natterjack’s mating rituals are nocturnal.
